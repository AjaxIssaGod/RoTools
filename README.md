# RoTools
Partial wrapper for the Roblox Web API in C#

# Download / Installation
https://github.com/AjaxIssaGod/RoTools/releases/tag/v0.1.0 - Official release

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract files in archive to any folder
3. Execute RoTools.exe
4. Use the listed commands below to get started

# Alternatively, 
Use Visual Studio or your favorite code writer/compiler and use the code to compile your own version.

# Commands
user (userid) - Show user information

list [friends/followers/following/groups/collectibles] (userid) - list data on specified user

# Note
This program is stable if the proper commands are used. If you plan on using this code in your own project, I would **highly suggest** rewriting Interpreter.cs to fit your own needs, as the existing code is very disoragnized. The rest of the classes should be okay to use.
