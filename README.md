# RoTools
Partial wrapper for the Roblox Web API in C#

# Commands
user (userid) - Show user information

list [friends/followers/following/groups/collectibles] (userid) - list data on specified user

# Note
This program is stable if the proper commands are used. If you plan on using this code in your own project, I would **highly suggest** rewriting Interpreter.cs to fit your own needs, as the existing code is very disoragnized. The rest of the classes should be okay to use.
